# slackmoji-scraper
This is a simple program that automates the process of downloading all emojis from https://slackmojis.com/. 

## Running Locally
Clone the repo and install the required dependencies. This can be done by running the following command from the root of the project directory:
```Bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
``` 
Then execute the script with your Python interpreter:
```Bash
python3 scrape.py
```
You can also choose to make the file a standalone executable by running:
```Bash
# make scrape.py executable
chmod +x scrape.py

# run the program (note: this requires setting the absolute path to interpreter in the script)
./scrape.py
```
